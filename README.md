# Lexical-Rich-Text-Editor
I tried to design my first rich text editor making use of Facebook's new open-source text editor framework - Lexical.

## What is Lexical
Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework with an emphasis on reliability, accessibility, and performance. Lexical aims to provide a best-in-class developer experience, so you can easily prototype and build features with confidence. Combined with a highly extensible architecture, Lexical allows developers to create unique text editing experiences that scale in size and functionality.
